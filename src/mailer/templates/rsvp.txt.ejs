Schedule
Check out our event schedule to find out what activities we have planned for you at www.sbhacks.com/schedule.pdf! We will post a more detailed schedule of our workshops and tech talks closer to our event date on our Facebook page, so keep an eye out for that and like us if you haven‚Äôt already to stay in the loop! We suggest planning out which sessions you‚Äôd like to attend ahead of time.


Transportation 

Our bus schedule will be sent out closer to the event date. Please check back for pick-up times and locations. There will be campus ambassadors waiting at each bus stop to take attendance. We advise you to check the bus schedule again right before the event to see if there are any changes for pick-up at your school.


If you are taking one of our charter buses, there will be staff in SB Hacks shirts waiting for you at the drop-off location in front of the Multi Cultural Center, which is right next to Corwin Pavilion, the main venue for the hackathon.


If you are flying in and are landing at the Santa Barbara Airport, you can take the Bus 11 or a taxi to the UCSB campus. Here is what the route looks like: https://goo.gl/maps/P1rDVvSirBR2


The destination address should be: ‚ÄúCorwin Pavilion, 494 UCEN Rd, Isla Vista, CA 93117‚Äù if you are searching this up on Google Maps or a ride sharing app.


If you arrive at UCSB, but get lost and don‚Äôt know how to reach the main venue, keep an eye out for the directional road and sidewalk signs. Feel free to ask a UCSB student to point you to where Corwin Pavilion or the MCC is. You can also reach out to a staff member on slack.


Parking Information
If you will be driving to SB Hacks, parking will be available on a first-come-first-serve basis. The location will be announced in our second logistics email.
