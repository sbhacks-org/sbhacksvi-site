Hi <%= locals.first_name %>,

Thank you for sending in your RSVP for SB Hacks V. We have important event logistics information to share — please read this all the way through!

Get HYPED
Get ready for a crazy fun weekend full of learning and innovation! 
Don’t forget to make an account for our slack if you still haven’t, as we will be making all instant announcements here: www.sbhacks.com/slack

Schedule
We will post a more detailed schedule of our activities and workshops closer to our event date on our Facebook page, so keep an eye out for that and like us if you haven’t already to stay in the loop! We suggest planning out which sessions you’d like to attend ahead of time.

Transportation 
Our bus schedule will be sent out closer to the event date. Please check back for pick-up times and locations. There will be campus ambassadors waiting at each bus stop to take attendance. We advise you to check the bus schedule again right before the event to see if there are any changes for pick-up at your school.

If you are flying in and are landing at the Santa Barbara Airport, you can take the Bus 11 or a taxi to the UCSB campus. Here is what the route looks like: https://goo.gl/maps/P1rDVvSirBR2

The destination address should be: “Corwin Pavilion, 494 UCEN Rd, Isla Vista, CA 93117” if you are searching this up on Google Maps or a ride sharing app.

If you arrive at UCSB, but get lost and don’t know how to reach the main venue, keep an eye out on Slack for a detailed map on how to reach Corwin Pavilion. Feel free to ask a UCSB student to point you to where Corwin Pavilion or the MCC is. You can also reach out to a staff member on slack.

Parking Information
If you will be driving to SB Hacks, parking will be available on a first-come-first-serve basis. Participants will park in Lot 22, near the Student Resource Building (SRB). Please remember to pay at the designated parking dispenser and leave the receipt on the dashboard of your vehicle.
