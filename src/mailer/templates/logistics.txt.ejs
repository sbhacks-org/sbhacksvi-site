Campus ambassadors on slack can be identified with a .ambassador ending to their slack username handle. 


Bus seats will be given on a first-come first-serve basis. Please arrive promptly at the scheduled pick-up time as we will not be waiting for anybody who is late. Bring your student ID so that the campus ambassadors can verify your identity.

Parking Information
If you will be driving to SB Hacks, you can park in Lot 22, near the Student Resource Building (SRB). You can purchase your parking permit at the ticket dispenser and select the ‚ÄúSB Hacks IV‚Äù option on the screen. The permit is $8 for Friday, $4 for Saturday, and $4 for Sunday. On the dispenser screen, there will be an option to buy multiple days at once. For example, if you arrive Friday, then you would be purchasing the permit for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, which is a total of $16. If you arrive on Saturday, then you would only need to purchase the permit for Saturday and Sunday. The dispenser accepts card for payment.




If you don‚Äôt mind carpooling with other hackers coming from the same area as you, we highly encourage you to post in ride-sharing groups on Facebook. Let‚Äôs help each other out! :)


Teams

We have been receiving messages asking if it is okay to have a 5-person team. Prizes given to teams are meant to only cover 4-person teams. Therefore, we recommend that you only have a max of 4 people in your team as you would have to work out who gets what if you win, but if this doesn‚Äôt matter to you, then you can have up to 5 people in your team.


We can‚Äôt wait to see everybody!!
