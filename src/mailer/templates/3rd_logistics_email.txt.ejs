Hello hackers,

Just a couple of last minute notes regarding parking and bus transportation:

Parking Information
If you will be driving to SB Hacks, you can park in Lot 22, near the Student Resource Building (SRB). You can purchase your parking permit at the ticket dispenser and select the “SB Hacks” option on the screen. The permit is $8 for Friday, $4 for Saturday, and $4 for Sunday. On the dispenser screen, there will be an option to buy multiple days at once. For example, if you arrive Friday, then you would be purchasing the permit for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, which is a total of $16. If you arrive on Saturday, then you would only need to purchase the permit for Saturday and Sunday. The dispenser accepts card for payment. Note: Do not park in Coastal Access parking, as the permit is not valid for these spots. Lot 22 is approximately a 10 minute walk away from Corwin Pavilion.

Bus Information
If you are from the school that the buses will be at (UCI, UCLA, USC), show your student ID to your school bus ambassador, and your name will be checked off a list. However, if you are NOT from the school, you will have to show the ambassador your student ID AND your acceptance email to SB Hacks VI. Bus seats will be first-come first-serve, so if you are closer to LA, we recommend that you take the UCLA bus, since the UCI bus may fill up more quickly.

Excited to see what everyone comes up with this weekend!

Cheers,
SB Hacks Team
