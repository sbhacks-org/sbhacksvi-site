SB Hacks will be occurring on January 11-13 (Fri-Sun) and weâ€™d love for our hackathon to be the first hackathon you #makewaves in for the 2019 year. Donâ€™t even think about adding this to your endless to do list -- visit www.sbhacks.com to register NOW for a crazy fun adventure at UC Santa Barbara!

Also, be sure to like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram to stay in the loop! Check out our event page here and invite your friends too! If you've already applied just ignore this message.

Cheers,
SB Hacks Team
