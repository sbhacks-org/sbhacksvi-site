Hello hackers,

More information to follow, especially in regards to bus transportation:

Transportation 
We are sending buses to the following schools:UC Irvine, USC, UCLA. 

On this bus schedule spreadsheet, you will find the specific pick-up times and locations for your stop. Please check this spreadsheet again the night before the event in case we refine the schedule.

We are currently looking for ambassadors! Ambassadors are guaranteed a seat on the bus and help serve as a communicator between the SB Hacks organizing team and their school’s hackers. If you are interested or want to learn more, please email us at team@sbhacks.com. We look forward to connecting with you on a more personal level!

During the day of the event, you will directly message your campus ambassador on Slack should any circumstances arise. They will be the ones to take your attendance. Campus ambassadors on slack can be identified with [Ambassador] ending to their slack username handle. 
Bus seats will be given on a first-come first-serve basis. Please arrive promptly at the scheduled pick-up time as we will not be waiting for anybody who is late. Bring your student ID so that the campus ambassadors can verify your identity. 

Once again, our venue address is: “Corwin Pavilion, 494 UCEN Rd, Isla Vista, CA 93117” if you are arranging transportation for yourself.

Teams
We have been receiving messages asking if it is okay to have a 5-person team. Prizes given to teams are meant to only cover 4-person teams. Therefore, we recommend that you only have a max of 4 people in your team as you would have to work out who gets what if you win, but if this doesn’t matter to you, then you can have up to 5 people in your team.

Have a question? Check out our FAQs on our website or email us at team@sbhacks.com.

Can’t wait!

Cheers,
SB Hacks Team
