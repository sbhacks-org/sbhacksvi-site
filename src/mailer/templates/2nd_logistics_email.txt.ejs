Communications
If you still haven’t created an account on the SB Hacks V slack, please do so now: www.sbhacks.com/slack We also recommend that you download the slack app on your phone in case you have any pressing questions or something come up on the day of.

We will also post announcements on the SB Hacks V event page www.sbhacks.com/fb-event, so click “Going” if you haven’t already to receive updates!


Transportation

We will be providing buses to the following schools: 

University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)

University of California, Irvine (UCI)

University of Southern California (USC)


Seating will be done on a first come first serve basis. We recommend arriving 20 minutes earlier than the pickup time, even earlier if you want to be guaranteed seating. Please communicate with your school’s ambassador for additional information. You can reach them through our event slack (sbhacks.com/slack). 


You MUST bring an ID as you will need this for both boarding and checking-in at the hackathon. You can find the bus itinerary at http://sbhacks.com/buses. If your school is not on this list, it is possible that you can board one of the buses in the list, but students of those schools have priority. Our Facebook event page will soon post a detailed bus schedule as well.


A popular option to commute to SB Hacks V is ridesharing with fellow hackers. This is a fun way to get to know your peers before the event. There are dedicated channels on the event slack page to find rideshares.


Once again, our venue address is: “Corwin Pavilion, 494 UCEN Rd, Isla Vista, CA 93117” if you are arranging transportation for yourself.


If you get lost once you arrive on the UCSB campus, try using our interactive campus map or Google Maps to find your way to Corwin Pavilion: http://mapdev.geog.ucsb.edu/# 

Parking Information
If you will be driving to SB Hacks, you can park in Lot 22, near the Student Resource Building (SRB). You can purchase your parking permit at the ticket dispenser, there will be an option to buy multiple days at once. For example, if you arrive Friday, then you would be purchasing the permit for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, which is a total of $16. If you arrive on Saturday, then you would only need to purchase the permit for Saturday and Sunday. The dispenser accepts card for payment.





If you don’t mind carpooling with other hackers coming from the same area as you, we highly encourage you to post on our slack. Let’s help each other out! :)


See you all in a few days!
