Hello!

Thank you for your interest in SB Hacks V! We received 2100+ applicants for our 450 spots this year and wish we could accommodate everyone. Unfortunately, we could not guarantee you a seat at the hackathon. Since you attend UCSB, we would still like to offer you a spot on the waitlist.

If you’re interested, come to SB Hacks on Friday, January 11, after 7 PM to see if we can accommodate you. We will let you into the event if there’s space. Historically, people have been able to get in this way, so please arrive on time!
