Hello,

We noticed you made an account for SB Hacks but didnâ€™t get to finish it yet. Maybe you were sidetracked, and we understand that. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re sending this email out to remind you to finish your app! 

Keep in mind that you can save your application even if you haven't done the optional essay portion yet. You can fill out the rest of the fields for now, save your app, and come back to finish the essay after you're all done with finals.

Apps are closing on December 20th, so tell your friends to sign up here!
