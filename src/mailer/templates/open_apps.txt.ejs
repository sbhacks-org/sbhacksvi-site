Hello,

Did you forget us? Well, we havenâ€™t forgotten you! As a thank you for signing up for our SB Hacks subscription list, weâ€™re sending out an exclusive email to let you be the first to know that applications for SB Hacks IV are now open! SB Hacks will be occurring on January 19-21 (Fri-Sun) and weâ€™d love for our hackathon to be the first hackathon you #makewaves in for the 2018 year. Donâ€™t even think about adding this to your endless to do list -- click HERE to register NOW for a crazy fun adventure at UC Santa Barbara! We made our registration form short on purpose, so itâ€™ll take 1 minute tops to fill out.

Also, be sure to like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram to stay in the loop!

Cheers,
SB Hacks Team
