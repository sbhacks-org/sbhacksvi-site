Hi everyone,

We hope you're enjoying your winter break so far! SB Hacks V applications close at midnight tonight, so we wanted to remind you that you've signed up but haven't submitted the application yet. The application takes only a minute and we would love to see you all at SB Hacks!

If you need the link again, apply now here: https://www.sbhacks.com/apply. After that, let us know you're coming and click "Going" here: sbhacks.com/fb-event

Thank you so much!
