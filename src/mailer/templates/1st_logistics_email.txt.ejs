Here is the first logistics update we have for you! Please read below carefully:

Communications
During the hackathon, we‚Äôll be using Slack to get to know each other, communicate announcements, and answer questions. Please join our Slack at sbhacks.com/slack. We also recommend that you download the slack app on your phone in case you have any pressing questions or something come up on the day of.

Furthermore, we will also post announcements on the SB Hacks VI event page at sbhacks.com/fb-event, so click ‚ÄúGoing‚Äù if you haven‚Äôt already to receive updates.

Transportation
We are sending buses to the following schools:
UC Irvine, USC, UCLA.

The official bus schedule will be sent out closer to the event date. Please check back for pick-up times and locations. There will be campus ambassadors waiting at each bus stop to take attendance. We advise you to check the bus schedule again right before the event to see if there are any last minute changes for pick-up at your school.

If you are taking one of our charter buses, there will be staff in SB Hacks shirts waiting for you at the drop-off location in front of the Multi Cultural Center, which is right next to Corwin Pavilion, the main venue for the hackathon.
If you are flying in and are landing at the Santa Barbara Airport, you can take the Bus 11, Uber/Lyft, or a taxi to the UCSB campus. Here is what the route looks like: https://goo.gl/maps/P1rDVvSirBR2

The destination address should be: ‚ÄúCorwin Pavilion, 494 UCEN Rd, Isla Vista, CA 93117‚Äù if you are searching for this up on Google Maps or a ride sharing app.

If you arrive at UCSB, but get lost and don‚Äôt know how to reach the main venue, keep an eye out for the directional road and sidewalk signs. Feel free to ask a UCSB student to point you to where Corwin Pavilion or the MCC is. You can also reach out to a staff member on slack.
