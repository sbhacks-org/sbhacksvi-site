Hello,

Did you forget us? Well, we havenâ€™t forgotten you! As a thank you for signing up for our SB Hacks subscription list, weâ€™re sending out an email to let you be the first to know that applications for SB Hacks IV is now open. SB Hacks will be happening on January 19-21 and weâ€™d love for our hackathon to be your first hackathon of the 2018 year! So eat some turkey this week and register here for a wild adventure at UC Santa Barbara!

Be sure to like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter and Instagram to keep updated! 

Sincerely,
SB Hacks Organizers
